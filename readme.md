### API Endpoints
| HTTP Verbs | Endpoints | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /contacts | To create a new contact |
| GET | /contacts | To retrieve all contact on the platform |
| GET | /contacts:contact/edit | To view the details of a single contact |
| PATCH | /contacts:contact/update | To edit the details of a single contact |
| DELETE | /contacts:contact | To delete a single contact |
